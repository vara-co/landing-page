Introduction:
This project was created to practice real-world scenarios for DOM manipulation. The functionality of this project shows how to append dynamically by addind data to the DOM, and to show how JavaScript can make a website more dynamic vs a static web page.

This project is meant to be a one page, which smoothly scrolls up and down depending on the element selected in the Navigation Bar. Hovering-over the element will highlight the section, but clicking on it, will create the smooth transitioning scroll.
